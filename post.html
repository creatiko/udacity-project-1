				<p>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Ye-ha! I call it luck. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! I'm trying not to, kid.</p>
				<p>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. <strong> You weren't on any mercy mission this time.</strong> <em> Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.</em> I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</p>

				<p>Don't underestimate the Force. I call it luck. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</p>
				<ol>
					<li>What?!</li>
					<li>Ye-ha!</li>
					<li>Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.</h3>
				<p>Ye-ha! Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!</li>
					<li>Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.</li>
					<li>I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?</p>
				<p>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.</p>
				<p>Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.</p>
				<p>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
				<p>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>
				<p>Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</p>
				<p>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Ye-ha! I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Red Five standing by.</p>
				<p>Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</p>

				<p>I find your lack of faith disturbing. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</p>
				<p>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
				<p>Ye-ha! Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.</p>
